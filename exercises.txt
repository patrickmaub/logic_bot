EXERCISE SET A 
For each of the following say whether the statement  is true (T) or false (F). 
1. In any valid argument, the premises are all true . 
2. In any valid argument, the conclusion is true. 
3. In any valid argument, if the premises are all t rue, then the conclusion is also 
true. 
4. In any factually correct argument, the premises are all true. 
5. In any factually correct argument, the conclusio n is true. 
6. In any sound argument, the premises are all true . 
7. In a sound argument the conclusion is true. 
8. Every sound argument is factually correct. 
9. Every sound argument is valid. 
10. Every factually correct argument is valid. 
11. Every factually correct argument is sound. 
12. Every valid argument is factually correct. 
13. Every valid argument is sound. 
14. Every valid argument has a true conclusion.

16. Every sound argument has a true conclusion. 
17. If an argument is valid and has a false conclus ion, then it must have at least 
one false premise. 
18. If an argument is valid and has a true conclusi on, then it must have all true 
premises. 
19. If an argument is valid and has at least one fa lse premise then its conclusion 
must be false. 
20. If an argument is valid and has all true premis es, then its conclusion must be

EXERCISE SET B 
In each of the following, you are given an argument  to analyze.  In each case, 
answer the following questions. 
(1) Is the argument factually correct ? 
(2) Is the argument valid ? 
(3) Is the argument sound ? 
Note that in many cases, the answer might legitimat ely be “can't tell”.  For 
example, in certain cases in which one does not kno w whether the premises are true 
or false, one cannot decide whether the argument is  factually correct, and hence on 
cannot decide whether the argument is sound.

Directions:   Translate each of the following statements into t he language of senten-
tial logic.  Use the suggested abbreviations (capit alized words), if provided; other-
wise, devise an abbreviation scheme of your own.  I n each case, write down what 
atomic statement each letter stands for, making sur e it is a complete sentence .  
Letters should stand for positively stated sentence s, not negatively stated ones; for 
example, the negative sentence ‘I am not hungry’ sh ould be symbolized as ‘ ~H’ 
using ‘H’ to stand for ‘I am hungry’.
